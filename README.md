## hi, hey, hello! ğŸ˜„
I'm Anya (or Anastasiya, if you prefer to be formal about it); I'm a *mostly* self-taught scientific programmer/developer, and I adore terrible web design. I have been called a hive-mind. Take that as you will.

### some projects I'm either currently working on or have previously: 
1. A cancer prediction model
2. Far too much FTC robotics
3. A CTF (updates to come,,, maybe)
4. UAV systems
5. Non-profit backend systems
6. Cysec/CS curriculum development

### languages i'm comfortable in 
Take these with a grain of salt, or seventeen, since 1.) languages aren't all that deep 2.) I learned brainf*ck first so I have bad taste.
1. Python
2. Java
4. Kotlin
5. JS/HTML/CSS (I group them, don't @ me)
6. Brainf*ck itself
7. SQL
8. Bash

### softwares
1. SLDWRKS (sims mostly)
2. Fusion 360 (modelling and animation mostly)
3. Keyshot (rendering)
4. Illustrator (laser cutting)
5. Inkscape (vector art, not necessarily *GOOD* vector art)
